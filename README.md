*README README README*.

Two branches, one the *main* without global state manager and the localStorage requirements.
And the second one *refactor* with all the game requirements, including localStorage and game details, as requested to be a part of the solution.

The *refacor* is much *better* and more polished branch, the preferred one to checkout.

Didn't want to merge them because i did a little break from coding after the initial results has been send, when i noticed that not all requestes been fulfilled. Sorry about that.

Thank you.
