Two branches, one the *main* without the localStorage requirements.
And the second one *refactor* with all the game requirements, including localStorage and game details, as requested to be a part of the solution.
Didn't want to merge them because i did a little break from coding after the initial results has been send, when i noticed that not all requestes been fulfilled. Sorry about that.

Thank you.
